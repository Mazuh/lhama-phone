# Lhama Phone

Softphone for llamas.

## Setting up for development mode

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You'll need Node +10 (hint: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
and had used `npm install` in this project directory once. A few scripts will be available.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and opens a desktop window for it.

You can still also open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.
